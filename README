    tictactoe.py -- A module that implements the Paper and pencil game
        Tic-tac-toe. The module includes the basic game mechanics and a
        computer controlled player. It can either be imported to create
        a custom version of the game or be run as a standalone script,
        in which case it will run a console based version of the game.
