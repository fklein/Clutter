This repository contains miscellaneous scripts and code snippets that serve no
particular purpose:

    tictactoe.py -- A module that implements the paper and pencil game
        Tic-tac-toe. The module includes the basic game mechanics and a
        computer controlled player. It can either be imported to create
        a custom version of the game or be run as a standalone script,
        in which case it will run a console based version of the game.

    hashtool -- A command-line tool for generating and verifying file hashes

    runjinja -- Process a Jinja2 template with data from various JSON sources
